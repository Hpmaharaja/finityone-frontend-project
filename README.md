  # Instructions

  The objective of this take home project is to build a 2-page HTML site with clean designs. The objective of the home page is to
  deliver some key information about a new product that is being released - FinityOne Financial Webinar. The objective of the second page is to be a simple
  form to allow a consumer to fill out their respective information to purchase/book the webinar.

  As a helper, you have 1 lifeline to get help from Heran (heran@finityone.com). Send an email to setup a Google Hangouts call to go over the lifeline.

  SUBMISSION: Email a zipped folder of your entire cloned repository with your work to heran@finityone.com

## STAGE #1

  FILE TO MODIFY: /client/dist/index.html

  The first stage of development is to create a simple home page for a FinityOne Financial Webinar. The product is a webinar to enable a user to
  better track their finances through a simple webinar. It is a completely FREE webinar that people can register to tune in LIVE.
  The home page should include 1 section ONLY:

  Quick Info + Call to Action
    - The first and only section, which should be the full size of the first screen that a user views when he/she visits the website. The content should be
    outlining the product with a button to direct the user to the next page (developed as part of STAGE #2).


## STAGE #2

  FILES TO MODIFY: /client/dist/salesClose.html, /client/public/css/main.css

  The second stage of development is to create a simple checkout/register page for the FinityOne Financial Webinar. This should include
  a form to collect some key pieces of information:
  - First Name (text 100 characters)
  - Last Name (text 100 characters)
  - Email Address (text 100 characters)
  - Phone Number (text 100 characters)
  - Biggest Financial Goal (textarea 2000 characters)

## STAGE #3

  FILE TO MODIFY: /documentation/index.js, /client/public/css/main.css
